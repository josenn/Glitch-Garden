# Version 0.1

This version is very bare bones and just includes a splash screen and a
start menu (the splash screen loads into the start menu after a few seconds)

# Version 0.2

In this version I added the first level as well as the main game background
which I also made a little coordinate system out of!

# Version 0.3
## <u>Animation</u>
### Lizard Enemy
	Added a Lizard enemy with a walk and jump animation<br>
	I would normally worry about functionality first bu this is experimental
	And I haven't done anything with animation yet
### Trophy
	Added a trophy object with some animation (the top part rotates while the bottom is scaled up and down)
	Nice keyframe practice
### Movement
	Began adding and playing with enemy movement (so far using transform.Translate)
### Spawner
	Created an enemy spawner and started spawning enemies using a coroutine (currently has no end condition)
