# Version 0.1

This version is very bare bones and just includes a splash screen and a start menu (the splash screen loads into the start menu after a few seconds)

# Version 0.2

In this version I added the first level as well as the main game background which I also made a little coordinate system out of!

# Version 0.3
### Lizard Enemy
	Added a Lizard enemy with a walk and jum animation<br>
	I would normally worry about functionality first bu this is experimental
	And I haven't done anything with animation yet
