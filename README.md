Will add more to this later.
Documentation is located in the documentation folder (obviously) and it contains version information (I am making plenty of backups
abd trying to get better and more consistent with documentation)
One note about source code is that whenever there is a // #region // #endregion it creates a foldable block
In IDEs like Visual Studio #region works fine without the // but my preferred editor is Atom so I use a package that
let's me insert blocks in the form // #region // #enderegion
I'm noting this because it may just appear as a comment to anyone else using this
