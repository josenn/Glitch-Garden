# Documentation 
Documentation is located in the documentation folder (obviously)
and it contains version information (I am making plenty of backups
and trying to get better and more consistent with documentation)

# Note about source code
One note about source code is that whenever there is a // #region // #endregion it creates a foldable block. <br>
In IDEs like Visual Studio #region works fine without the // but my preferred editor is Atom so I use a package that
let's me insert blocks in the form // #region // #enderegion <br>
I'm noting this because it may just appear as a comment to anyone else using this.
